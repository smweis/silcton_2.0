Participant was initially confused about why they had to follow the path backwards. When the second route loaded, pt asked how many more sections they would have to memorize (I explained the routes again). However, they did take time to look around plenty and weren't rushing through. When the 4th route was loading, the pt's browser gave them an error and they clicked the ""I'm Finished"" button again so it skipped to the pointing task. I had them change the number at the end of the link from 6 to 5, and the 4th route successfully loaded.

In the MRT, the participant was unable to click on the blocks for a bit. Eventually they were able to click, but time ran out at question 9. In the first route, the participant was unable to look in the virtual world. We gave it time to load, but technical issues forced the participant out of the zoom meeting. Once they reentered the zoom meeting, they went back to the silcton tab again and were able to move. The participant’s screen was laggy and the participant got stuck/frozen a few times. The participant was not able to make Silcton full screen during the 3rd route. During the 4th route, the participant could not look and was frozen staring at the ground. After about 5 minutes, and escaping onto another screen, it eventually loaded and let the participant look and move. It continued to be a little laggy. Participant could not look around during the pointing task. This problem lasted for about 5 minutes and the screen was frozen, not allowing the participant to escape or anything. The participant used the 3 swipe Mac feature on the trackpad to leave the Silcton screen and then return. This fixed the pointing issue and the participant was then able to point and click during the pointing task. During the Map Arrangement task, the participant could not scroll down or view the buildings at first (problem lasted for about 4 minutes) Participant refreshed the page and then completed the task.
