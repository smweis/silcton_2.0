Participant was initially confused about why they had to follow the path backwards. When the second route loaded, pt asked how many more sections they would have to memorize (I explained the routes again). However, they did take time to look around plenty and weren't rushing through. When the 4th route was loading, the pt's browser gave them an error and they clicked the ""I'm Finished"" button again so it skipped to the pointing task. I had them change the number at the end of the link from 6 to 5, and the 4th route successfully loaded.
